# It's triggered manually (workflow_dispatch) and helps to ensure that the web installation process works as
# expected and helps to detect any issues early.
#
# The workflow sets up a PostgreSQL database, PHP, clone moodle-webinstall repository and run the install Behat test.
# It also takes a screenshot of the Moodle installation page and uploads it as an artifact so it can be verified in
# case of failures.
#
# For more information about the web install testing, see https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-webinstaller-test
